# ethical-hacking-community
A private ethical hacking community where companies can post their code, and users will reply with security vulnerabilities. Companies must pay their effort with money. The access is limited, only the community users have the permision to see companies' posts and the right to reply to them. To create an account, an invitation is needed. Invitations can be generated by a community user. I used Material UI, React, Redux, NodeJS and Firebase.
